 **Project: Simple HTML File**

**Description:**
This project contains a simple HTML file with a basic structure. It serves as a starting point for creating web pages and can be easily customized to suit various needs.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
   - A basic understanding of HTML

2. **Setup:**
   - Clone or download the project repository.
   - Open the `index.html` file in your preferred text editor or IDE.

**Code Overview:**

The `index.html` file consists of the following sections:

1. **Document Type Declaration:**
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   ```
   This line specifies that the document is an HTML document.

2. **HTML Element:**
   ```html
   <html lang="en">
   ```
   This element defines the root of the HTML document and sets the language attribute to "en" (English).

3. **Head Section:**
   ```html
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Document</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
   </head>
   ```
   - The `<head>` element contains metadata and information about the document.
   - The `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag specifies the character encoding used in the document, which is UTF-8.
   - The `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` tag sets the viewport properties for mobile devices, ensuring that the document scales correctly to different screen sizes.
   - The `<title>Document</title>` tag defines the title of the document, which will be displayed in the browser's title bar.
   - The `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` tag links an external CSS file named `style.css` to the HTML document. This CSS file can be used to style the elements in the document.

4. **Body Section:**
   ```html
   <body>
   
   </body>
   ```
   - The `<body>` element contains the main content of the document.
